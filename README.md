####VDAB Module 11 HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript

## Overview 
The purpose of the UFO Sightings website project was to practice html, javascript and bootstrap to develop a dynamic website capable of querying a data file. 

In this exercise, the UFO Sightings web page was built using html (Hypertext Markup Language) primarily for the web page structure and then css (Cascading Style Sheets)and Bootstrap for styling queues. The app.js (Javascript) was written to give the webpage table searchable functionality while the data.js file served as the searchable content for the webpage table.

## Results
The background color and top banner "The Truth Is Out There" referenced color and jumbotron css elements. The basic form organization was determined by html but the font sizing, font color, and button emphasis elements were determined by bootstrap style components.

The webpage pic shows the Filter Search filtered on Enter Date 1/13/2010. The Filter Search functionality was driven by the app.js file  whereas the table data referenced the data.js file.

## Summary
In summary, a drawback of this current webpage is that is displays the entire datafile on the page but the datafile only contains two weeks worth of 2010 and only includes US data.
The site could be improved in many ways. Firstly by including much more data including other countries and an extended timeframe. Secondly by including functionality to download the queried data. Thirdly functionality to reset the query should be added that doesn't require refreshing the entire website.
