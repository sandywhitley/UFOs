#### VDAB Module 11 HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript

## Overview 
The purpose of the UFO Sightings website project was to practice html (Hypertext Markup Language) css (Cascading Style Sheets), Bootstrap and Javascript to develop a dynamic webpage capable of querying a data file. 

In this exercise, the UFO Sightings web page was built using html primarily for the web page structure and then css (Cascading Style Sheets) and Bootstrap for styling queues. The app.js was written to give the webpage table searchabilty while the data.js file served as the content for the webpage table.

## Results
The background color and top banner "The Truth Is Out There" referenced color and jumbotron css elements. The basic form organization was determined by html but the font sizing, font color, and button emphasis elements were determined by bootstrap style components.

This webpage pic shows the Filter Search filtered on 1/13/2010. The Filter Search functionality was driven by the app.js file  whereas the table data referenced the data.js file.

## Summary
In summary, a drawback of this current webpage is that it displays the entire data file on the page but the data file only contains two weeks from 2010 data and is limited to the US only. 

The site could be improved in many ways. Firstly, by including much more data including other countries and an extended timeframe. Secondly, by including functionality to download the queried data to a csv or excel file. Thirdly, functionality to reset the query should be added that doesn't require refreshing the entire web page.
