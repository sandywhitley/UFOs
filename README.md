## Overview 
The purpose of the UFO Sightings website project was to practice html, javascript and bootstrap to develop a dynamic website capable of querying a data file. 

In this exercise, the UFO Sightings web page was built using html (Hypertext Markup Language) primarily for the web page structure and then css (Cascading Style Sheets)and Bootstrap for styling queues. The app.js (Javascript) was written to give the webpage table searchable functionality while the data.js file served as the searchable content for the webpage table.

## Results
Here is the finished webpage.

## Summary
In summary, a drawback of this current webpage is that is displays the entire datafile on the page but the datafile only contains two weeks worth of 2010 and only includes US data.
The site could be improved in many ways. Firstly by including much more data including other countries and an extended timeframe. Secondly by including functionality to download the queried data. Thirdly functionality to reset the query should be added that doesn't require refreshing the entire website.
